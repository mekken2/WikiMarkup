# Adding Bullets in Wiki Markup

When we have a really large list of text that we want to add a star in front of it,
Or lets say after editing a Wikipedia article, We want to add bullet points in front
of all the new lines. Doing this by cursor and keyboard will take much useless time 
and effort. So, We wanted to Automate this by using Python and this script does exactly
that for you.

## Steps to run this script
1. Copy text which you want to edit 
2. Run WikiMarkup.py
3. Modified text will automatically be copied to clipboard
